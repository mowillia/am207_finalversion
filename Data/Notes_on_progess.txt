Notes on Project progress:

15/04/2015 - 
Read in the total life expectancy data using pd.DataFrame.from_csv and wrote code to determine the year with the most recorded data
 
22/04/2015 - 
Wrote code to print out the code needed to write in all the data files ran that code and then ran the printed code to read in the data files 

Choose 2010 for the initial analysis as it is the year with the most data most often, ranking first 8 times

25/04/2015 - 
Run some code to check typical values of the adjusted R^2 for total life expectancy versus factors 4 and 5 and for lists of factors roughly 10-20 categories long

Also, reorganize the data in the GSH2013 and voter turnout files so that they follow the same format as the world bank data

26/04/2015 - 
Write the simulated annealing algorithm to determine which factors most influence life expectancy

27/04/2015 -
Fix bugs in the simulated annealing algorithm
